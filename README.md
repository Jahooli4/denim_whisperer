The Denim Whisperer is an online eccomerce site selling garments made from recycled denim.

## User Experience (UX)

After researching into similar existing sites I decided to opt for a simple, intuitive layout to maximise potential sales. I opted fot a colour pallette of different blues to give the site a denim theme.
