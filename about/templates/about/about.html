            <p>
                Here at The Denim Whisperer we are a snall independent company committed to big change in the fashion industry! Did you know it can take up to 7,500 litres of water to create a pair of jeans? Cotton is a thirsty plant to grow and because of this it can completely destroy the local eco system. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With this in mind we decided to create patchwork jeans using only second hand and vintage denim. By turning unnwanted denim into funky new pieces we are saving denim from landfill aswell as preventing the need for new denim to be made, it's a win all round!
